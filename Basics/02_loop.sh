# A common way to read files line by line in Bash is using a while read loop. 
# This is efficient and handles spacing better than a for loop.

# Key Concepts
# - IFS=: Clears the Internal Field Separator so the line is not split by default characters (spaces, tabs).
# - read -r: Reads the line as-is, preserving backslashes.
# - "$1": Refers to the first positional argument, i.e., the input file.
# - sed 's/:/ /g': Replaces all colons in each line with spaces for display.

echo "While loop reading file and Only username and shell are printed:"

  echo "$user $shell"

# Enhancing the Script â€“ Parse Fields into Variables
# You can load each colon-separated field into its own variable:
# This breaks each line (like /etc/passwd) into individual fields using : as the delimiter.

# | Component     | Description                                 |
# | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
# | `while read`  | Reads file line by line                     |
# | `IFS`         | Controls how the line is split              |
# | `-r`          | Prevents backslash interpretation           |
# | `< "$1"`      | Redirects the input file to the loop        |
# | `sed`         | Allows simple transformations on the line   |
# | Field parsing | Load structured fields into named variables |
